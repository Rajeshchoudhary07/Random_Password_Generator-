# Random_Password_Generator-

Create a command-line password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.
### Introduction 
Passwords are a means by which a user proves that they are authorized to use a device. It is important that passwords must be long and complex. It should contain at least more than ten characters with a combination of characters such as percent (%), commas(,), and parentheses, as well as lower-case and upper-case alphabets and numbers. Here we will create a random password using Python code.

### Key Concepts and Challenges:

1.Randomization: Learn how to generate random characters and strings.


2.User Input Validation: Validate user input for password length and character types.


3.Character Set Handling: Manage different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
